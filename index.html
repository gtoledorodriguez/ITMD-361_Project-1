    <h3>Current Jobs</h3>
    <p>I currently work two on-campus jobs.</p>
    <p>
      For my first job, I  work as the Student Instructor (SI) for CS 115, Object-Oriented Programming 1, and
      CS 100, Intro to the Profession. I have previously been the SI for  CS 116, Object-Oriented
      Programing 2. For CS 115, I walked around and answer any questions students may have. For CS 100, I am
      actually the instructor for the lab. Often times, I also have to teach a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my second job, I work as a Scholar for the Association for Computing Machinery-Women (ACMW),
      of which I am the treasurer of. As a scholar I tutor in all CS classes, as well as any other classes I
      have taken. Although, males are welcomed, this service is intended for female-identifying students.

    <h3>Other Activities</h3>
    <p>
      I am a research assistant for the Wireless, Networks, Communication and Policy Research Center (WNCP).
      My partner and I are in charge of big data processing and analysis. We translate code written in Matlab into Python.
      As well as creating data visualizations for data collected from the IIT Spectrum Observatory. These visualizations
      will be integrated into the WNCP website, which is currently being developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am part of many orgs on campus but the one I dedicate most of my time to is ACMW. We hold bi-monthly meetings,
      workshops, and plan for conferences, at least once a semester. This semester we are planning for two conferences,
      the Grace Hopper Conference and the Women of Color STEM Conference.
